<p>LMW is de lokale marketing webshop voor Etos en Gall winkels en wordt gehost door Altavia Sumis (de APS van Etos en Gall zeg maar).</p>
<p>Alles waar AH voor staat wordt geserviced door APS, alles van Etos en Gall door Sumis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;De LMW is onderdeel van het Myretailer platform van Sumis en we zijn in ontwikkeling met Sumis om meerdere modules te gaan gebruiken van Myretailer.</p>
<p>De koppelingen voor Etos en Gall winkels mogen dan ook niet verwijderd worden!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Voor technische specs en integratie opzet wellicht handig om even te schakelen met Sumis aangezien zij de achterkant van LMW onlangs over hebben gezet naar een nieuwe versie.

Due to challenging timelines, it has been decided to keep this backend for the TTG in box and personalization pilot phase and even to extend the functionalities as the MuleSoft team has not enough capacity to realize all the required APIs. However, before the end of the project the M2Mobi backend must be decommissioned. The fact that this backend is hosted on Amazon Web Services is, besides the Architecture directions, an additional driver for this.","Albert Heijn - Store Execution","Albert Heijn IT","External Service","EU Application","Decommissioned","3","Koen Wolters","Gijs Jongma","Service Desk_NCR_L1","Taptogo","Store and central","Priority 3: Total application down;
